<h1>CYK Parser</h1>

<p>
  This is a C++ implementation of CYK Algorithm. 

  CYK algorithm is a parsing algorithm for context free grammar.
In order to apply CYK algorithm to a grammar, it must be in Chomsky Normal Form. It uses a dynamic programming algorithm O(n^3) to tell whether a string is in the language of a grammar.

## Usage üîß

Program requires two input files.
- First file defines alphabets, variables and production rules.
- Second file contains strings to check against this grammar.

Sample input file format is given which works perfectly.

However, this program is space(" ") and semicolon(";") insensitive.
Moreover, ALPHABETS and VARIABLES section are also not necessary. It will work fine :)
BUT "PRODUCTIONS:" tag is necessary. Otherwise, it will not show any results.
